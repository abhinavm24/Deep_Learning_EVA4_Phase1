This notebook has detailed explanation with examples on below items

1) Difference in memory sharing between 'torch.tensor' and 'torch.from_numpy'
2) Determining transpose of a tensor with torch.transpose() 
3) Concatenating 2 tensors with torch.concat()
4) How to apply a scalar scaling to tensor by creating a numpy array & applying scaling on numpy array using [:] 
5) Indexing a tensor and selecting values for those tensor indexes
6) Selecting specific rows only from a given tensor by indexing using another tensor
7) Selecting rows, columns and elements coming at intersection of specified rows & columns from tensor using numpy-style indexing
8) Using Reshape and view to change the dimensions of a tensor
9) Tensor multiplication using torch.mm()
10)Taking sum of elements inside tensor using torch.sum()
11)Difference between BGR and RGB while displaying. Converting BGR to RGB

12)Using expand_as
